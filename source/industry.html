              <p>Dating apps are becoming an increasingly common way to meet new people. Some companies are trying to maintain interest in dating apps through technology, using blockchain and artificial intelligence for dating advice. Others may even accept cryptocurrencies as payment for using the platform.</p>

              <p>Blockchain technology will make the online dating industry transparent. Already today, there are several platforms that, using this technology, are able to guarantee the integrity of online relationships:</p>

              <li class="info__detail">
                <span>Hicky</span>
                <p>It is one of the blockchain startups that is built to make this transformation happen. Hicky aims to bring credibility to the industry by leveraging the immutability of the blockchain. According to research, more than 50% of all people who have used online dating platforms have lied to the other person when communicating on the Internet. Lack of trust has made online dating not only frustrating but even dangerous. Hicky subjects new users to a rigorous vetting process to ensure that it fully matches its claimed identity. Identification will include voice checking and face scans. The decentralized offline dating (DAD) mechanism used will reward users with HKY tokens for good behavior and punish bad ones, which ultimately simplifies the use of the platform and makes it favorable for all participants.</p>

              <li class="info__detail">
                <span>Luna</span>
                <p>Luna is another blockchain-based solution designed to tackle the challenges of the online dating industry. Luna uses a constantly improving matching algorithm. The user is notified of the match and if he / she agrees to a meeting, both participants receive tokens as a reward. If the provided information about the identity turns out to be false, all received tokens are taken back. Luna's own cryptocurrency is also awarded to users who read and respond to messages in a timely manner. This makes the platform very interactive as it not only helps to find love, but also allows you to earn tokens that can be exchanged on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

            Blockchain is a technology for encrypting and storing data (registry),
            which are distributed over many computers connected in a common network.
            Blockchain is a digital database of information that reflects all
            completed transactions. All records in the blockchain are presented in
            the form of blocks, which are interconnected by special keys. Each new
            block contains data about the previous one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain is used to store and transmit digital data. These can be
            both financial and non-financial assets (for example, images or objects
            of the video game industry). Blockchain technology allows assigning an
            asset unique information about its ownership to a specific person.
            At the same time, such information cannot be forged, deleted or quietly
            changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic principles of the blockchain (the distribution and combination
            of data about the authenticity of a document into blocks) were developed
            back in the early 1990s based on even earlier mathematical concepts.
            In 1991-1992, American scientists Wakefield Scott Stornetta, Stuart Haber
            and Dave Byer described the technology of sequential creation of data
            blocks, in which a certificate of authenticity and information about the
            date of generation are fixed using cryptographic algorithms and a hash
            tree. But at that time there was no technical possibility for the
            practical implementation of this idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2004, the American programmer Harold Thomas Finney II developed the
            RPoW system, which is considered the prototype of the cryptocurrency.
            In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (this is the pseudonym of a person or
            group of people) in a scientific article on the first cryptocurrency,
            Bitcoin, proposed using blockchain technology to create a decentralized
            and independent payment system with a limited supply of assets. Bitcoin
            development began in 2007 and ended in 2009. Blockchain technology
            became relevant when there was a need for fast and reliable transfer
            of digital data.
          </p>
          <h3>How Blockchain Works</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain allows each member of the network to have access to a
            distributed database. At the same time, the blockchain does not store
            the data itself, but records of events (transactions) in their
            chronological sequence. All new records are checked for authenticity â€“
            to be entered into the blockchain, they must be confirmed by the
            majority of network participants. Records are grouped into blocks,
            which are combined into chains. Data that has entered the blockchain
            cannot be changed or deleted without violating the integrity of the
            block chain.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Blockchains</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain can work both in a public (open) network, to which any
            user has access, and in a private (closed), for example, in a corporate
            network in case of using confidential data. In private versions of the
            blockchain, different levels of access for users and different complexity
            of information encryption can be provided. The most famous example of a
            public blockchain is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Corporations use
            blockchain not only in the financial sector, but also in other sectors,
            for example, in the entertainment industry (for issuing tickets) and
            healthcare (to protect patient data).There are also hybrid networks that
            combine the properties of both open and closed networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain can be classified according to various criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>by transaction objects:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              information;
            </li>
            <li>
              virtual value (value, the analogue of which is absent in the "real world" â€“ for example, Bitcoin);
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>by type of network access:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              unlimited (networks in which participants are allowed to carry out any activity);
            </li>
            <li>
              limited (networks that limit the activities of participants);
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>according to the requirements for passing identification:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              anonymous;
            </li>
            <li>
              pseudo-anonymous;
            </li>
            <li>
              complete identification;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>according to the applied network consensus protocol:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>PoW (Proof-of-work)</span> â€“ the right to certify a block is given to a
              participant based on the his performance oof some fairly complex
              work that satisfies predetermined criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>PoS (Proof-of-stake)</span> â€“ the right to certify a block is given to the
              account holder when the amount of his funds and the period of their
              ownership meet the specified criteria. The formulas for calculating
              the criteria may vary slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>PoS + PoW</span> â€“ a hybrid of PoW and PoS, when blocks can be verified both
              through calculated PoS criteria and PoW<br> enumeration. The purpose of
              this approach is to complicate the recalculation of the entire chain
              (from the very first<br> block), which is possible in the case of using
              PoS in its purest form.

            <li>
              <span>PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance), Paxos, RAFT</span> â€“ multi-stage
              network consensus establishment algorithms. The<br> algorithms of this
              group allow the blockchain to function at low cost and have a
              significant throughput, but are weakly<br> resistant to an increase in
              the number of participants.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span>Non-BFT (Non Byzantine Fault Tolerance)</span> â€“ consensus algorithms that
              are unstable to behavior in which some participants start working
              against the network. Such algorithms are applicable in closed
              networks with full identification.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>by the presence of a central administrator:</b>
          </p>
          <ul class="perfect__range">
            <li>
              there is a central administrator;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is no central administrator.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Where is Blockchain Used?</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain is used in all areas where the speed of information
            transfer with a high degree of protection is required. The technology
            is used to launch and operate cryptocurrencies and digital currencies,
            when concluding smart contracts for the supply of goods, when generating
            non-fungible tokens (NFT), in banking and legal areas, in network
            administration and in the gaming industry. Blockchain technologies are
            used in the work of public authorities (for example, when conducting
            and processing the results of referendums and voting), in the activities
            of public and non-public corporations, public organizations and
            individuals.
          </p>
          <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
          <p>
            Any cryptocurrency functions on the basis of blockchain technology.
            The technology is used both in the issuance (release) of new cryptocurrencies
            and the generation of new tokens (coins), as well as in settlements with
            existing ones. Now there are more than 13,000 cryptocurrency projects in
            the world. Calculations in cryptocurrencies are used by PayPal and Square
            payment systems and one of the largest international banks, JP Morgan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies tend to have high volatility. For investments in
            cryptocurrencies, there are specialized cryptocurrency exchanges.
          </p>

            Some countries are launching pilot projects to create national digital
            currencies based on blockchain technology. China has achieved high
            results in this regard â€“ the digital yuan became the first digital
            currency adopted in a major global economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) have also been launched by the
            Central Bank of the Bahamas (sand dollar), the Eastern Caribbean Central
            Bank (DCash) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (e-naira). The governments
            (or Central Banks) of the Netherlands, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan and
            Ecuador have announced plans to issue their national digital currencies.
          </p>
          <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology allows you to enter into smart contracts. Smart
            contracts are fully digital contacts, information about which is
            protected by encryption. Their key difference is the automatic control
            and execution of the clauses of the contract. When the conditions are
            met, the contract ends automatically, without additional actions and
            the participation of lawyers. Smart contracts allow you to track the
            entire supply chain, which reduces or completely eliminates the
            possibility of counterfeiting or illegal actions with products.

          <h3>NFTs</h3>
          <p>
            NFT is a type of token where each instance is unique, it cannot
            be replaced or exchanged for another token. NFT testifies to the
            ownership of any asset in the blockchain and allows you to sell and
            buy virtual objects: music, photographs, paintings, drawings.
          </p>
          <h3>Game Industry</h3>
          <p>
            Another area of â€‹â€‹blockchain application is the gaming industry. Based
            on cryptocurrency technologies, GameFi projects are being implemented
            (from the English "game" and "finance"), combining game mechanics and
            NFT. These are online games that record everything that happens in the
            game in transactions on the blockchain and allow players to earn real
            money. Using the blockchain, you can buy and sell virtual characters
            and artifacts.

          <h3>Who Are the Miners?</h3>
          <p>
            Blocks in the blockchain network, for example, when issuing
            cryptocurrencies, are added using the mining procedure â€“ collecting
            and processing information about ongoing transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In large blockchain networks, this requires significant computing
            power, so the creation of blocks in them is carried out by special
            persons â€“ miners.
          </p>
          <h3>What is a Blockchain Wallet?</h3>
          <p>
            A blockchain wallet is a special program that allows you to account,
            store and perform other actions with digital assets, in particular,
            with cryptocurrency. When registering a wallet, a person gets access
            to it in the form of an open (public) and a closed (private) key â€“
            a cryptographic code. The wallet stores records about the state of
            the account of its owner and the entire history of transactions.
            At the same time, the cryptocurrency is not stored directly in the
            wallet, it contains only information about public and private keys,
            and the coins themselves are stored in the blockchain. Most often,
            blockchain wallets are anonymous.
          </p>
          <h3>Decentralization &amp; Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            Decentralization and distribution are both an advantage and a
            disadvantage of blockchain technology. Information is stored
            simultaneously on all network devices, there is no single data
            management and storage center. Data changes on each individual
            device occur independently, but are recorded by the rest of the
            system participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transactions take place almost instantly, but their
            confirmation may take some time, which depends on the algorithm
            of the blockchain network. All<br> transactions with assets are
            confidential, only the wallet number is indicated, and commissions
            are minimal, since miners register transactions instead of centralized
            intermediaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The disadvantages of decentralization are the need for multiple
            network participants to maintain its integrity and stability, as
            well as the cost in terms of computing power.
          </p>
          <h3>Is Blockchain Technology Reliable?</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology is relatively secure, but not without
            vulnerabilities.Despite decentralization and distribution, there
            is a risk of hacker attacks. There is also the possibility of users
            with large computing power conspiring to make changes to the
            blockchain. In addition, there is a risk of losing assets due to
            Internet fraud. And the loss of a private hash key to access the
            blockchain wallet actually leads to the loss of assets, that is,
            a direct loss of funds.
          </p>
          <h3>Blockchain Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main advantages of the blockchain are the transparency of
              the technology due to decentralization and distribution and the
              impossibility of changing or destroying information within the
              blocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The disadvantages of the blockchain include a poorly developed
              regulatory and legislative framework in the vast majority of
              countries in the world. This leads to attempts by regulators to
              control operations in the blockchain, up to a ban on the circulation
              of<br> cryptocurrencies (for example, the Chinese authorities did this).
              Regulators, as a rule, explain their actions by the risk of
              fraudulent<br> schemes when exchanging digital assets for real money
              due to the anonymity of transactions. At the same time, another
              disadvantage of the blockchain is the irreversibility of
              transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digital assets, especially cryptocurrencies, also have high
              volatility, which can lead to a complete loss of funds.
            </li>
